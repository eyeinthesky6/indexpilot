## Implementation Notes

### Algorithm vs. Implementation

**Important**: Algorithms and mathematical concepts themselves are **not copyrightable**. Only specific code implementations are protected by copyright.

**IndexPilot Approach**:
- We implement algorithms **inspired by** academic research
- We provide attribution as good practice and academic courtesy
- We do not copy exact implementations without proper licensing
- We verify licenses for any code we directly use or adapt

### Attribution Philosophy

IndexPilot provides attribution to:
1. **Respect academic work** and give credit to researchers
2. **Comply with license requirements** (when applicable)
3. **Maintain transparency** about algorithm sources
4. **Support academic community** by acknowledging contributions
