# Academic Algorithms Licensing Verification Summary

**Date**: 07-12-2025  
**Status**: ✅ Verification Complete - Attributions Created  
**Project**: IndexPilot

---

## Executive Summary

All academic algorithms identified in research have been analyzed for commercial use. **All algorithms are safe to use** because:

1. **Algorithms themselves are NOT copyrightable** - Only specific code implementations are protected
2. **IndexPilot implements inspired concepts** - Not exact copies of implementations
3. **Attribution provided** - As good practice and academic courtesy

## Legal Basis

### Algorithms Are Not Copyrightable

**Key Legal Principle**: Algorithms, mathematical formulas, and abstract ideas are **not copyrightable** under copyright law. Only specific code implementations are protected.

**IndexPilot Approach**:
- ✅ Implements algorithms **inspired by** academic research
- ✅ Creates our own implementations based on concepts
- ✅ Does not copy exact code implementations
- ✅ Provides attribution as good practice

**Result**: ✅ **Legally Safe** for commercial use
